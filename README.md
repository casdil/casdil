# Welcome to My GitHub ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”¹ A curious programmer fully focused on C these days.  
ðŸ”¹ This space is all about experimenting, having fun, and learning through hands-on coding.  
ðŸ”¹ I enjoy exploring concepts by writing real code, making mistakes, and improving along the way.

ðŸ›  **Tech Stack & Interests**  
- Language: C (previous experience with Node.js for web APIs, React for UI, and C# WinForms)  
- Areas: Systems programming, embedded projects, and exploring how things work under the hood  

ðŸš€ Here, itâ€™s all about the joy of coding and discovery â€” no pressure, just pure curiosity and growth.
